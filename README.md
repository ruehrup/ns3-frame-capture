# ns3-frame-capture

This repository includes patches to the network simulator ns-3 in order to support frame capture (i.e. message-in-message reception) for wifi frames. Patches modify the wifi model (esp. interference helper) in ns-3.16.

The experimental investigations preceding this code adaption are explained in: **Paul Fuxjaeger, Stefan Ruehrup: Validation of the NS-3 Interference Model for IEEE802.11 Networks. 8th IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC 2015), October 2015**. 
Please cite this publication when using the patch in your project.
